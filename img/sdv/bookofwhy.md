## Ch1 THE LADDER OF CAUSATION

1.We humans realized that the world is not made up only of dry facts (what we might call data today); rather, these facts are glued together by an intricate web of cause-effect relationships.

2.In roughly the last 50,000 years, something unique happened, which some call the Cognitive Revolution and others (with a touch of irony) call the Great Leap Forward. It's about "Why"?

3.A causal learner must master at least three distinct levels of cognitive ability:seeing, doing, and imagining.

1) Seeing: Observing & Association. What does a symptom tell me about a disease?
We say that one event is associated with another if observing one changes the likelihood of observing the other.

2) Doing: Intervention. If I take aspirin, will my headache be crued?
We can also use experiments to learn the effects of interventions, and presumably this is how babies acquire much of their causal knowledge.

3) Imagining: Retrospection & Understanding & Counterfactuals. Was it the aspirin that stopped my headache?
Counterfactual learners, on the top rung, can imagine worlds that do not exist and infer reasons for observed phenomena.
